# Bodensee Consulting Patterns

This is a simple patterns generator that conforms to the Coporate Design of the [Bodensee Consulting e.V.](https://www.bodensee-consulting.org/) student consultancy.

It was built for the Interal Project (IP) Whitepaper, which was carried out as part of my candidate phase at the end of the year 2020.
